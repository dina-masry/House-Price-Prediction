# üè° House Price Prediction

## üåü Project Overview

This repository contains my solution to the Kaggle House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques competition. The objective of this competition is to predict the final sales price of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, based on 79 explanatory variables describing almost every aspect of residential homes. This project showcases a comprehensive machine learning pipeline, from data exploration and preprocessing to Neural Network-based model training and submission generation for a complex regression task.

## ‚ú® Features

- Robust Feature Engineering: Creation of new, more informative features from existing ones to enhance model performance.

- Comprehensive Data Preprocessing: Handling of missing values, encoding of categorical variables, and scaling of numerical features.

- Advanced Regression Modeling with Neural Networks: Application of powerful neural network architectures to predict house prices accurately.

- Model Evaluation: Assessment of model performance using relevant regression metrics (e.g., RMSE).

- Kaggle Submission Generation: Code to format predictions into the required submission file.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Technologies & Libraries

- Python: The primary programming language used for the entire pipeline.

- Pandas & NumPy: Essential libraries for efficient data manipulation and numerical operations.

- Matplotlib & Seaborn: Used for creating informative data visualizations to aid in EDA and understanding results.

- Scikit-learn: A comprehensive library for various machine learning algorithms, preprocessing tools, and evaluation metrics.

- TensorFlow / Keras: For building, training, and optimizing deep learning models, specifically Neural Networks.

## üßπ Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

The quality of the input data significantly impacts model performance. This project includes meticulous steps for data preparation:

- Handling Missing Values: Various strategies were employed to address missing data, including imputation based on feature type (e.g., mean, mode, or specific categories for categorical features) or dropping columns where appropriate.
  
- Feature Scaling: Application of scaling methods (e.g., StandardScaler) to ensure numerical features are on a comparable scale, which is crucial for Neural Networks.

## üß† Modeling Approach

The project focuses on building a robust regression model, with a core emphasis on Neural Networks. The approach includes:

 - Neural Network Architecture Design: Designing and implementing a neural network to learn complex relationships within the housing data and predict sale prices.

- Model Training: Training the developed neural network model on the preprocessed dataset to minimize prediction errors.

## üìä Results
The Neural Network model developed in this project aims to provide highly accurate house price predictions. The performance can be assessed using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), which is the primary evaluation metric for this competition. Lower RMSE values indicate better predictive accuracy.
Detailed results and specific RMSE , MAE , R^2 scores can be found within the Colab notebook.
